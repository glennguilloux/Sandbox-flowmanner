## WHAT CHANGED

| File | Δ | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| `src/app/.../graphs/[id]/executions/page-client.tsx` | +25/-25 | Renamed `executionId` → `runId` in `fetchDetail`, fixed `input_data` extraction, extracted `fetchNodeStatesForRun` helper |
| `src/hooks/__tests__/useExecutionPoll.test.ts` | +330 | 12 test cases for v2 events polling (created in prior session, committed here) |

---

## WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Renamed `executionId` → `runId` for clarity
- `fetchDetail` parameter renamed from `executionId` to `runId` — matches what `fetchRun()` and `fetchRunEvents()` expect
- All internal references within the function updated
- New `fetchNodeStatesForRun` helper also uses `runId`

### 2. Fixed `input_data` extraction
- **Before:** `((run.snapshot as Record<string, unknown>)?.input_data as Record<string, unknown>) ?? null`
- **After:** `run.input_data ?? null`
- The `Run` interface has `input_data` as a direct field — no need to dig through `snapshot`

### 3. Extracted nested events fetch into helper
- Created `fetchNodeStatesForRun(runId)` — an async helper that fetches events and extracts node states
- Uses clean `filter`/`map` pipeline instead of imperative for-loop
- Internal try/catch returns `[]` on failure (best-effort)
- Eliminates the nested try/catch in `fetchDetail`, making error flow easier to follow
- Helper defined inside component body (follows existing pattern of `fetchDetail`)

## TESTS RUN + RESULT

```bash
cd /home/glenn/FlowmannerV2-frontend
npx vitest run src/hooks/__tests__/useExecutionPoll.test.ts
```

| Suite | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `useExecutionPoll v2 events` | 12 | ✅ All pass |

**Breakdown:**
- `task.started` → running node states
- `task.completed` → completed node states with output
- `task.failed` → failed node states
- `task_id` fallback for `task.started` events
- Incremental event cursor (`fromSequence` tracking)
- Accumulated node states across poll ticks
- Terminal state stops polling
- `clearState` resets everything
- Configurable `v2PollingIntervalMs`
- Events without `node_id`/`task_id` ignored
- Events fetch failure handled gracefully
- v1 path (with `workflowId`) skips events fetch

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
- [x] 12/12 polling tests pass
- [x] Code reviewed by code-reviewer-deepseek — no issues found
- [x] Committed (`c846170`) and pushed to `origin/master`
- [x] Frontend deployed to VPS by user

## NOT DONE / DEFERRED

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Reduce event limits (1000 in executions page, 10000 in run-timeline) | Deferred — acceptable for now but could cause slowness for long-running workflows |
| Move `fetchNodeStatesForRun` outside component body | Minor optimization; follows existing pattern of `fetchDetail` being inline |
| Rename `graphs/` route directory to `blueprints/` | URL path still says `/graphs/` but content is all blueprint terminology |

---

## KNOWN RISKS

1. **1000 event limit on detail view open** — Every time a user expands an execution, `fetchRunEvents` fetches up to 1000 events. For workflows with many events, this could be slow. Consider filtering by task-level events or paginating.
2. **`run-timeline.tsx` fetches 10,000 events** — Even more aggressive. An optimization pass on event fetching limits is recommended.

---

## SESSION METRICS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files modified | 1 (`page-client.tsx`) |
| Files committed | 2 (includes `useExecutionPoll.test.ts` from prior session) |
| Lines changed | ~50 in `page-client.tsx` |
| Tests | 12/12 pass |
| Code review iterations | 1 |
| TypeScript errors | 0 |
| Deploy | User-deployed to VPS |

---

## FUTURE NATURAL WORK

1. **Reduce event fetch limits** — 1000 events per detail view open + 10,000 in run-timeline could be optimized
2. **Move `fetchNodeStatesForRun` to module level** — Small perf improvement since it has no closure dependencies
3. **Rename `graphs/` route to `blueprints/`** — URL path is stale terminology
