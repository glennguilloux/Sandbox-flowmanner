# EXIT AUDIT — Blueprints Full Sweep (2026-06-29)

## WHAT CHANGED

### Frontend repo (`/home/glenn/FlowmannerV2-frontend`)

| File | Δ | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| `src/components/layout/nav-config.ts` | +25/-5 | Added Blueprints nav group between Missions and Automations (per user choice). 2 items: Browse (`/blueprints`) + My Blueprints (`/blueprints?tab=manage`). Updated header comment from "6 product groups" to "7". |
| `src/components/layout/__tests__/floating-nav.test.tsx` | +19/-3 | Updated top-tier assertion from 9 → 10 groups with the new ordering; added Blueprints shape assertion; added `blueprintsManage` to the next-intl mock map. |
| `src/i18n/locales/en.json` | +1 | Added `nav.blueprintsManage: "My Blueprints"` translation key. |
| `src/lib/api/runs.ts` | +15 | Added `BlueprintVersion` interface and `fetchBlueprintVersions()` for `GET /api/v2/blueprints/{id}/versions`. |
| `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/blueprints/page-client.tsx` | +38 | Wired existing-but-unused `publishBlueprint` import. Added `Send` icon, `publishingId` state, and `handlePublish` handler. Publish button appears in Manage table actions only for `status === "draft"`. Updates row in place via `setBlueprints` map; toast confirms success. |
| `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/blueprints/[id]/executions/page-client.tsx` | +146 | Wired `abortRun` and `retryRun` imports. Added `Square` and `RotateCw` icons, `abortingId` and `retryingId` state, `handleAbort` and `handleRetry` handlers. Abort button (red) shows on `running`/`executing`/`pending`/`queued` rows; Retry button (emerald) shows on `failed`/`aborted` rows. Click events stop propagation so they don't toggle the row's expand panel. Added Version History collapsible panel that lazy-fetches `fetchBlueprintVersions` on first expand; renders list of `v{n}` + description + timestamp. |

### Backend repo (`/opt/flowmanner`) — housekeeping

| File | Δ | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| `backend/app/services/integration_health_service.py` | +7 | Wrap the except branch in a session `rollback()` to prevent cascading `PendingRollbackError` after one health check fails. Uses `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` per ruff TRY203. **Uncommitted leftovers from prior session.** |
| `backend/app/tasks/integration_health_tasks.py` | +13 | Dispose the async engine at the start of the Celery task. Prefork workers inherit connections bound to the parent process's event loop; disposing forces fresh connections on the current loop. **Uncommitted leftovers from prior session.** |

## WHAT DID NOT CHANGE BUT WAS TOUCHED

- None — every file edit landed.

## TESTS RUN + RESULT

```bash
$ npx tsc --noEmit              # typecheck
EXIT=0

$ npx vitest run src/components/layout/__tests__/floating-nav.test.tsx
✓ src/components/layout/__tests__/floating-nav.test.tsx (46 tests) 595ms
Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  46 passed (46)

$ npx eslint <6 touched files>
8 problems, 0 warnings — all 8 are pre-existing on master (verified via
git stash + re-lint). 0 new errors introduced.

$ docker compose exec backend pytest -q
156 failed, 3543 passed, 126 skipped, 53 errors in 62.43s
```

The 156 pytest failures are identical to the prior session baseline —
pre-existing integration tests (`connected_db`, `graph_execution`) needing
external OAuth credentials. No backend source change affected test
behavior (housekeeping fix targets runtime path, not test paths).

## DEPLOY

Frontend deployed to VPS (per user request) — full pipeline green:
- rsync ~30s
- docker build ~107s
- container recreate + nginx restart
- health checks: implicit pass (no output)

Container `flowmanner-frontend` recreated with the new image.
Live URL: https://flowmanner.com/blueprints

Backend deploy NOT needed — the only backend change (housekeeping) is a
non-functional improvement to error handling and Celery worker startup;
no schema change, no API change, no new behavior visible to clients.

## COMMITS

| Repo | SHA | Message |
|------|-----|---------|
| Backend | `ce538a4` | fix(integrations): rollback session on health-check failure; dispose engine on prefork workers |
| Frontend | `c5825eb` | ship: 2026-06-29T17:28:36Z *(auto-message from `ship`; should have been conventional `feat(blueprints): nav + publish + abort/retry + version history`)* |

The frontend commit message is the auto-message from the `ship` script.
The change covers 4 logical concerns (nav, publish, abort/retry, versions)
bundled into one commit — a finer split would have been ideal, but the
script's auto-commit is what we got. If you want a tighter history, an
interactive rebase can split this.

## NEXT SESSION HANDOFF

**Blueprints feature is now feature-complete for the v2 surface.** The four
gaps from the prior session are all closed:

1. ✅ **Nav link** — Blueprints appears in the signed-in nav between
   Missions and Automations with two items (Browse + My Blueprints).
2. ✅ **Publish workflow** — Draft blueprints now have a "Send" button in
   the Manage table actions column. Clicking publishes to the Browse
   catalog; the row updates in place to status=published.
3. ✅ **Abort + Retry on executions** — In-flight runs get a red Stop
   button; failed/aborted runs get an emerald Retry button. Both
   inline in the executions row.
4. ✅ **Version history UI** — Collapsible panel at the top of the
   executions page lazy-fetches from `GET /api/v2/blueprints/{id}/versions`.

**Known caveats:**
- The frontend commit message is `ship: <timestamp>` — conventional
  format not used (the `ship` script auto-commits before deploy). If
  the history matters, rebase and rewrite.
- The Manage tab still doesn't show a status filter dropdown (API
  supports it, frontend doesn't pass the query param). Low-priority
  follow-up — out of scope for this sweep.
- The `PAGE_SIZE_OPTIONS` constant from the old graphs page is still
  missing — `perPage = 20` is hardcoded in Manage view.

**Next natural move** could be:
- Wire the existing `blueprint_type` filter on `fetchBlueprints` so
  Manage tab can filter by DAG vs Solo vs Swarm.
- Add a per-blueprint "Create Run" form on the executions page
  (currently only "Re-run" with the blueprint's default input).
- Build a side-by-side Run Diff UI using `fetchRunDiff()` — backend
  supports it, frontend doesn't expose it yet.
- Migrate the old `v1` graphs SDK generated file
  (`src/lib/sdk/services/GraphsService.ts`) out of the repo — last
  trace of the deprecated v1 surface.

## FILES THIS AGENT DID NOT TOUCH BUT EXIST

- Untracked files: none
- Deleted files: none
- Backend pre-existing uncommitted from prior session: now committed
  as `ce538a4` (no longer untracked).
